2. Program Overview:

   - Bidders have the option to increase their bids if they have already placed one.
   - The program handles ties and displays the winner(s) with their bids.
   - The program provides a clear console screen between bid entries for privacy.
   
3. Program Execution:

4. Program Usage:
   - When prompted, enter your name and bid amount as a positive integer.
   - If you have already placed a bid, the program will display your current bid and ask if you want to increase it.
   - If you choose to increase your bid, enter the amount by which you want to increment it.
   - Once all the bidders have entered their information, indicate if there are any other bidders.
   - The program will determine the highest bidder(s) and display the winner(s) with their bids.
